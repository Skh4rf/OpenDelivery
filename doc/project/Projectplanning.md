# Projectplanning

At the beginning of the project we didn't really know which APIs and principles to use. For this reason we decided to start a scratch project
in which we were able to try out all the features and thus continue to improve and expand them. The decision to make the project as a UWP project 
is was also made. The reason for this was the high compatibility with any kind of API.

So when we dared to tackle the first "proper" project, we already had a good basic idea of ​​how to build the whole thing. We thought about which functions
and user interfaces we could need and wrote them down in a github project to later on use them as issues.

In addition please provide your current state of your tasks. I am ok with several ways of providing that information:

- added into the project same as this documentation
- linked to a tool which is availalbe for me (e.g. github-project-boards, trello-boards, ...)
- included into this documentation as a csv/excel file
- ...

You just have to check if you fullfill the following requirements:

- the task name is visible
- a short description for the task is availalbe
