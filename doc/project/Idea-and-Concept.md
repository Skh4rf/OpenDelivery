# Idea and Concept

The idea of ​​this project is to develop a suitable disposition application for small companies. I got inspired by my uncle, who sells his farm products himself by delivering them with car
and has always dreamed of such software that would make his life easier. Of course, the goal is not immediately to create a marketable version, but to get to know the basic concepts for such an 
application. We want a clear user interface, a map with a route, get the position of a device, set up a database, communicate with it, process the data, geocode addresses and serialize objects. 
Everything should work independently of each other to remain flexible.
